## Cobination - Permutation - PowerSet of stuff:
Cobination: *2^N*
> Why: 
When the order doesn't matter, it is a Combination.
Example: my Salad contains of Apple, Salad and Orange. It doesn't matter which order your salad is, It's salad.

Permutation: N^N (When the order does matter it is a Permutation.)
>Cal:
N^r
where N is the number of things to choose from,
and we choose r of them,
repetition is allowed,
and order matters.

PowerSet: *2^N*
>Why: The power set of elems is determine by whether or not we chose the new element.

Example: _,_,_ => 2^3 of combination for 0 and 1
	  _,_,_,_ 2^4 of combination for 0 and 1
