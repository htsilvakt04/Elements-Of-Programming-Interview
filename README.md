## Cobination - Permutation of stuff:



#### Cobination: About selecting things

> nCr: `select r elems from n`

Total: n! / (r! (n - r)!)

-----

#### Permutation: About arranging things

> nPr: `arrange r elems from n`

Total: `n! / (n - r)!`





**Notes**: Don't care about orders leads to less elems than do.
**Exp:** 1,2,3

> Care orders: {1, 2, 3}, {2, 1, 3}, {3, 2, 1} ...
> Do'nt care: all are the same as we have one of 3 elems: 1,2,3. Could use {1,2,3} for indicate that.
